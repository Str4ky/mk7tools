- Added support for the 1 pixel offset of rankmenu and rankrace ui images
(Imported CHPACK that already has an offset can get their offset disabled.
If a CHPACK that had an offset and you decide to do nothing it will keep
the offset but if you do disable this offset, it will be REMOVED so be
careful when messing aroud with offsets.)
